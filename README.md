# LinkedList-Sum
This Java program will recursively iterate through my custom Linked List.
The list is populated from a text file of integers separated by spaces or lines and chosen from the user's system to be added into the Linked List nodes.
Each node is then recursively added together and compared. If the program finds two nodes who's sum equals zero, the program will return Yes. If the algorithm gets to the end of the Linked List and no zero sums have been found, we return No.
